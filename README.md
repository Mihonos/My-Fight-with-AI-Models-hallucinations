# Playwright E2E test with API validation

## Overview
This brilliant, simple E2E Test with API Validation was fully generated by an AI Model, using (Playwright with JS)    
Features: POM, Integration (FE ↔ BE), Playwrights API interceptor, and real-time network call logging.  
Sorry to those who expected "Instalation" (follows) after "Details", I had to put "Curiosities" before because it's the fun part, in fact the whole project is.

## Curiosities
### or Why did I called the project "My Fight with AI Models hallucinations"  
My initial prompt to the AI model was to create an advanced automation script that demonstrates both UI manipulation with BE validation, on the website of his choice.   
Despite the quick response with the complete script and explanation, I had to debug the test after the first run due to an incorrect web element selector. (..happened twice in a row with 2 different tests)  
Why does this happen? AI often guesses selectors that might work, based on common patterns, after my question:  
I had to fix 1st selector, ('input[name="q"], input#query-builder-test') there is no such selector for the search box, would you call this a case of hallucination?

A few more useful advices for you who are going to automate with AI:   The wiser the prompt, the better the output code as a result will be!!! Make thoughtful, precise prompts from the beginning so you dont have to change the entire script afterwards like I did, Implement POM pattern, use getter methods for locators, divide SearchPage and ResultsPage (they were the part of the same class) + other small corrections. 
After my initial prompt numerous changes followed:    
1. Implement POM pattern  
2. use getter methods for locators  
3. divide SearchPage and ResultsPage (they were the part of the same class)  
4. practicly I had to divide everything into separate classess because the test came linear after my first prompt (I didn't emphasise POM initialy)

## Instalation
Prerequisites:  
Node.js ≥ 18 (latest LTS recommended)  
npm / yarn / pnpm  
Playwright (npm install playwright)  

## To Run This:
`bash`

`node tests/GitHubSearchTest.js`   

It will:  
	1. Open GitHub search  
	2. Search for "playwright automation"  
	3. Extract results from UI  
	4. Capture API calls in background  
	5. Compare frontend data vs backend responses  
	6. Generate a complete test report  
    7. Save screenshot as proof  

## Features or What This Script Does:

1. Frontend Testing 🖥️  
	• Searches GitHub repositories  
	• Extracts visible data (repo names, URLs, stars, descriptions)  
	• Validates UI elements are present  
2. Network Interception 🔍  
	• Captures ALL API requests the page makes  
	• Records API responses with status codes and data  
	• Logs every network call in real-time  
3. Backend Validation ✅  
	• Checks API response status codes (200 OK)  
	• Validates response data structure  
	• Compares backend item count vs frontend  
	• Checks for expected data fields  
4. Data Integrity 📊  
	• Validates each result has required fields  
	• Checks URLs are valid  
	• Ensures data completeness  
5. Reporting 📄  
	• Saves complete test report as JSON  
	• Takes screenshots for evidence  
    • Generates summary of findings  

## Real-World Use Cases  
This pattern is used for:    
• E-commerce testing - Verify prices match between UI and API  
• Form submissions - Check if backend receives correct data  
• Search functionality - Validate search results consistency  
• Payment flows - Ensure transaction data is accurate  
• API contract testing - Verify frontend consumes API correctly
