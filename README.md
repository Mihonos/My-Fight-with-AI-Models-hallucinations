# Playwright E2E test with API validation

## Overview
This brilliant, simple E2E Test with API Validation was fully generated by an AI Model, using (Playwright with JS)  
Features: POM, Integration (FE ↔ BE), Playwrights API interceptor, and real-time network call logging.  

## Instalation
Prerequisites  
Node.js ≥ 18 (latest LTS recommended)  
npm / yarn / pnpm  
Playwright (npm install playwright)  

## To Run This:
`bash

node advanced-automation.js`  
It will:
	1. Open GitHub search  
	2. Search for "playwright automation"  
	3. Extract results from UI  
	4. Capture API calls in background  
	5. Compare frontend data vs backend responses  
	6. Generate a complete test report  
    7. Save screenshot as proof  

## Features or What This Script Does:

1. Frontend Testing 🖥️  
	• Searches GitHub repositories  
	• Extracts visible data (repo names, URLs, stars, descriptions)  
	• Validates UI elements are present  
2. Network Interception 🔍  
	• Captures ALL API requests the page makes  
	• Records API responses with status codes and data  
	• Logs every network call in real-time  
3. Backend Validation ✅  
	• Checks API response status codes (200 OK)  
	• Validates response data structure  
	• Compares backend item count vs frontend  
	• Checks for expected data fields  
4. Data Integrity 📊  
	• Validates each result has required fields  
	• Checks URLs are valid  
	• Ensures data completeness  
5. Reporting 📄  
	• Saves complete test report as JSON  
	• Takes screenshots for evidence  
    • Generates summary of findings  

## Real-World Use Cases:
This pattern is used for:
• E-commerce testing - Verify prices match between UI and API
• Form submissions - Check if backend receives correct data
• Search functionality - Validate search results consistency
• Payment flows - Ensure transaction data is accurate
• API contract testing - Verify frontend consumes API correctly
